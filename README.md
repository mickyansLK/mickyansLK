# Hi, I’m Michael Ansah 👋

## About Me
I’m a **Data Engineer** specialising in building **scalable, production-grade ELT/ETL pipelines**, robust **data models**, and **analytics infrastructure** that deliver measurable business value.

My work focuses on transforming raw, fragmented data into **reliable, analytics-ready datasets** that enable decision-making across marketing, finance, and operations.

I enjoy working across the full data lifecycle — from ingestion and orchestration to modelling, analytics, and stakeholder enablement.
